# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption (Linux Bash Script and Python)

## 📌 Introduction
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.  

This Bash script allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm** with a custom shift value. Additionally, all encrypted and decrypted messages are **automatically saved in a log file** for future reference.
